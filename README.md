# This Repo contains various ML Models
* It can be used as a resource, but I update it once in a while whenever I learn about more ML Models
* To add some models you can send a pull request, I will be more than happy to pull it (only those models which are available in the repo and have more eloborate explainations)
* Also bear with me I too am learning about stuffs :')
